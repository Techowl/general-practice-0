==================

This is a repo where I'll work on a simple coding challenge, for the sake of gathering feedback and building my skills.

The coding challenge I'm working on here can be found at http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands.

The portion of my work that was time-boxed to one hour is in the 'One-Hour' directory. The rest of the files represent my more complete work.
